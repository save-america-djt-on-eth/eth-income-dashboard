   ```plaintext
   INFURA_API_KEY=<key>
   ```

### PM2 Setup
7. **Install PM2:**
   ```sh
   npm install -g pm2

   ```sh
   pm2 start index.js --name eth-income-dashboard
   ```

10. **Check PM2 Logs:**
    ```sh
    pm2 logs eth-income-dashboard
    ```

11. **Check if Server is Running:**
    ```sh
    netstat -tuln | grep 3000
    ```

### Test the Endpoint
12. **Test Endpoint with curl:**
    ```sh
    curl "http://localhost:3000/api/data?timeFrame=7d&simulate=false"
    ```

### Optional: Reinstall PM2 and Restart Server
13. **Reinstall PM2:**
    ```sh
    npm install -g pm2
    ```
