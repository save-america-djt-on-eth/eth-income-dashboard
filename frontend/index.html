        <p>"Oh, look at you with your manually donated memecoins, feeling all warm and fuzzy inside! How quaint. Meanwhile, the real patriots are riding the Save America $DJT on Ethereum wave, where 2% of every transaction automatically zips straight to Trump's verified wallet! No muss, no fuss, just sweet, sweet crypto-fueled democracy in action. So tell me, traditional memecoin hodler, when was the last time you actually bothered to make that donation? If your coin has sent less than Trump's automated ETH income generator, $DJT, can you really claim to support the movement? Or are you just another slacktivist, hodling onto empty promises and missed opportunities? Time to put your money where your meme is, folks!"</p>
